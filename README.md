# How to do this in Flutter?

Cheat sheet for react-native developers.

> Built with [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/) and [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)

## Motivation

As a react-native dev I found Flutter really similar to react-native in many ways. However when I first approached Flutter, turned out that doing simple things like fetchng data from back-end or building statefull component is not as straightforward as in React Native (actually it _is_ straightforward after the first time :smirk:)

This repo contains a cheet sheet with examples in React Native and their alternatives written in Flutter
